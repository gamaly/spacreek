## [Spa Creek Water Testing](https://gamaly.shinyapps.io/SpaCreek/ "Spa Creek Water Testing").


This water testing reporting tool supports the ongoing analysis of water in the Spa Creek and Back Creek areas of Annapolis, MD. The platform is built in the R/Shiny web development framework. On load, the application pulls data from a googledocs spreadsheet, conducts some minor data cleaning, and visualizes the data across a number of tabs.
